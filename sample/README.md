jQuery Ripples Plugin
=====================

By the powers of WebGL, add a layer of water to your HTML elements which will ripple by cursor interaction! Maybe also by touch, though I haven't tested that.

Important: uses the WebGL extensions `OES_texture_float` and `OES_texture_float_linear`. Works only with same-origin images (unless the image has the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header set appropiately).
